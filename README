Safe icon support library for the iPhone. Uses a unique ID for each combination of packages, so icon state is never lost via respring or uninstalling a new package.

Example usage (in the initializer function of your extension):

 dlopen("/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/IconSupport.dylib");
 [[objc_getClass("ISIconSupport") sharedInstance] addExtension:@"theNameOfMyExtension"];
